A Tetris clone game.
Features a high score system, next block display, block and line counters and multiple difficulty levels. Self-made graphics.
There is also background music, but I removed it for the online version to be sure it doesn't break any copyrights.
Made with Java using Slick2D/LWJGL OpenGL game library.
